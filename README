Danbooru Client - v.0.5.1

Danbooru Client is an application to access Danbooru based image boards (link), using their REST API. This means the ability of viewing and downloading images without using a browser. 

Requirements

- KDE 4.3
- PyKDE 4 (tested with PyKDE 4.3)
- PyQt 4 - at least version 4.5
- Python 2.5 or newer

Installation

Danbooru Client uses CMake. Unfortunately, due to the way CMake works, it requires a working compiler and the KDE 4 development headers installed. 
To install, issue the following commands in the source directory:

mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
make

Followed by "make install" as root (or using sudo)

This will install Danbooru Client in your system KDE install.

Known limitations

- Currently you can only download or view only one image at a time. Such a limitation will be removed in the future.
- You cannot retrieve more than 100 posts. This is a forced limit in the Danbooru API. However, you can use pagination ("More results" button) to work around this limitation.
- There is no way to blacklist images based on rating. Again, this is a limit of the Danbooru API
